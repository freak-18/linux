Suggested Pointers For Linux Administration Skills 


1. *Linux Basics & System Structure*

   * An ISO image is used to install Linux as it contains the complete OS setup files.
   * The */etc* directory stores essential system configuration files.

2. *User & Permission Management*

   * Use passwd <username> to update a user’s password.
   * Linux differentiates permissions for *user, **group, and **others* on each file.

3. *File & Group Administration*

   * Use chgrp <groupname> <file> to change a file’s group ownership.

4. *System & Resource Monitoring*

   * Use systemctl status <service> to check if a service is active.
   * vmstat helps analyze CPU, memory usage, and overall system performance.

5. *Scripting, Scheduling & Networking*

   * A simple Bash script like echo $USER displays the logged-in username.
   * The at command schedules one-time tasks.
   * nmcli is used to view active network connections and manage network settings


----

1. *Linux Installation Settings* – During installation, users configure language, keyboard layout, time zone, disk options, and software packages.

2. *Swap Space Purpose* – Swap acts as overflow memory, improving system stability and performance when RAM is full.

3. *Guided Partitioning* – Linux can auto-allocate partitions such as / (root), /home, and swap using guided partitioning.

4. *Mount Points* – Mount points attach directories (e.g., /home, /var) to the filesystem so they become usable after boot.

5. *Password & Security Policies* – Tools like chage set password expiry, warning days, and inactivity rules for user security.

6. *User & Group Management* – Users can be added to groups using commands like usermod -aG, enabling proper access control.

7. *Identity Files* – /etc/passwd and /etc/group store core user and group information used by Linux for authentication.

8. *Process Management* – Commands like pstree, ps -ejH, fg, bg, jobs, and kill help track and control parent-child processes and jobs.

9. *Bash Scripting Concepts* – Loops (for, while), variables, and automation techniques help process files, logs, and system tasks.

10. *Permissions, Collaboration & Auditing* – File permissions, umask settings, shared directories, and system logs (/var/log) ensure secure collaboration and help administrators track system activity.
